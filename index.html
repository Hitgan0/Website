                    Hey there! Thanks for visiting my website, my name is Erwin Hitgano. A little about myself, I am a New York City native, born and raised in Queens. 
                    At my core, I am a learner, a planner, and a person who isn't afraid to face a challenge. I always strive for excellence in my work, and I deeply value making connections with others, and collaborating with them too!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I love hiking, solving puzzles, rock climbing, videogames, and learning new songs on my guitar.
                    I always seek to make my code the best it possibly can be! Planning out the steps before hand so that I can stay streamlined, staying organized with my coding style, and keeping my focus, composure, and drive when I inevitably run into a bug or encroaching deadline.
                    You'll find me at my best when I'm brainstorming solutions, and at my worst when I can't get down the plucking pattern for a new song.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you stick around to the end, and don't be afraid to shoot me an email if you'd like to get into contact :D
                </p>

                        <p>
                            Took part in an intensive Software Engineering internship/bootcamp from June 2025 to September 2025. Here I reviewed core Java concepts and learned about architecting, developing,
                            and deploying a fullstack application. Learned about the MVC model and reviewed the 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming. Demonstrated capability to learn quick and adapt to change with daily
                            tasks and weekly projects that included using Java to create command line applications, using MySQL to create a database and query it, and HTML, CSS, JS and React to create an interactive frontend.
                            Participated in weekly code reviews where instructors gave feedback that I incorporated both into my code and myself. Collaborated in group settings in both leadership and supporting positions for daily
                            coding assignments and the final project. At certain points, I was under extreme stress and tight deadlines, but kept composure and showed professionalism throughout the process.

                            streamlined existing processes by debugging existing programs together with that mentor. I also created
                            a guide for future interns on configuring a local environment and actively took part in weekly meetings.

                            Worked at New Country Day Camp as a Bus Captain and Summer Camp Counselor in the summers of 2024 and 2023. As a Bus Captain I oversaw children ages 6-13 in a changing environment

                            to managers frequently with updates on any camper injuries, behaviors, and situations that needed extra attention.
