                    <p class="about-me-text">
                        Thanks for visiting my website! I am a New York City native, born and raised in Queens. 
                        At my core, I am a learner, a planner, and a person who isn't afraid to face a challenge. I always strive for excellence in my work, and I deeply value making connections and collaborating with others!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I love hiking, solving puzzles, rock climbing, videogames, and learning new songs on my guitar.
                        I always seek to make my code the best it possibly can be! Planning out the steps before hand so that I stay streamlined, staying organized with my coding style, and keeping my focus, composure, and drive when I inevitably run into a bug or encroaching deadline.
                        You'll find me at my best when I'm brainstorming solutions, and at my worst when I can't get down the plucking pattern for a new song.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hope you stick around to the end, and don't be afraid to shoot me an email if you'd like to get into contact!

                            Took part in an intensive Software Engineering internship/bootcamp from June 2025 to September 2025. Here I reviewed core Java concepts and learned about architecting, developing,
                            and deploying a fullstack application. Learned about the MVC model and reviewed the 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Demonstrated capability to learn quick and adapt to change with daily
                            tasks and weekly projects that included using Java to create command line applications, using MySQL to create a database and query it, and HTML, CSS, JS and React to create an interactive frontend.
                            Participated in weekly code reviews where instructors gave feedback that I incorporated both into my code and myself. Collaborated in group settings in both leadership and supporting positions for daily
                            coding assignments and the final project. At certain points, I was under extreme stress and tight deadlines, but kept composure and showed professionalism throughout the process.

                            Under the wing of a mentor, I took high priority tickets off of the teams backlog to complete and
                            streamlined existing processes by debugging existing programs together with that mentor. I also created
                            a guide for future interns on configuring a local environment and actively took part in weekly meetings.

                            Worked at New Country Day Camp as a Bus Captain and Summer Camp Counselor in the summers of 2024 and 2023. As a Bus Captain I oversaw children ages 6-13 in a changing environment
                            while communicating with parents and guardians. Kept track of children and traffic conditions to update parents on pick-up times and any detours.

                        <p>
                            The University Management System (UMS) is a full stack application that makes managing college easier for students and faculty by combining the platforms 
                            for course enrollment, tuition payment, and assignment submission into a singluar site. There are 3 roles: Admin, Instructor, and Student. Admins are
                            able to create/edit/delete courses, sections for those courses, and users. Instructors are able to create/edit/delete assignments, links to course materials,
                            and grades. Students are able to enroll into and drop courses, submit and edit assignments, pay tuition, and view and download their transcript. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The project is a Java Maven project with Spring dependencies. Spring Boot is used to manage dependency injection and Spring Security (along with JSON Web Tokens) are used
                            to secure the roles, ensuring no access to restricted pages for each role. Spring's JDBC template is used to communicate with the MySQL backend and JUnit and Mockito are used
                            to fully test the backend. For the frontend, React is used to create a responsive front-end. The Stripe API is used for tuition payment, HTML2PDF is used for transcript download,
                            and MUI is used for course filtering.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This project was completed in a group of 4 over the course of 2 weeks, with an additional technical presentation at the end. It really put all of us to the test,
                            having each of us work over 10+ hours each day just to meet deadlines. During that time I learned so much about not only what goes into making a full-stack application, but what
                            I am capable of. Many times we had to learn on the go, and really take the learning into our hands, having to find our own solutions. There were many times where we didn't think
                            we'd make a deadline, but we persevered together and put out a product we are all extremely proud of!

                        <h3>CPU Scheduling System</h3>
                        <p>
                            The CPU Scheduling System was a project that I completed in my 3rd year of college. It simulated processes waiting in memory for a CPU resource, using that resource, then waiting in I/O.
                            As a group of 3, we implemented 4 CPU scheduling algorithms (First Come First Serve, Round Robin, Shortest Remaining Time, and Shortest Job First) to manage process execution order.
                            The project was completed in C. Though my group did not end up scoring great in the final submission, this project contributed a lot to my personal growth. It taught me
                            the value of professionalism, and keeping my composure through a stressful time. It also taught me about how important time management is. Multiple nights were spent staying up
                            trying to implement one last feature or iron out a bug. If only we had the foresight of planning our schedule and minimizing distractions, maybe we could've scored better.
                            Regardless, I am proud of this project because it acted as a stepping stone for me to grow into a more organized, logical, and well-rounded individual.
